**#Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game**

**A simple and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Play against the computer, track your score, and enjoy a clean and responsive user interface.**

**📌 Introduction:**

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. It was created as a beginner-friendly exercise to understand basic web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic in JavaScript.

**🚀 How to Use:**

**1.Clone the repository:**

*git clone ```https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors.git```

**2.Navigate to the project folder:**

*cd ```rock-paper-scissors```

**3.Open the game:**

*Open the ```index.html``` file in any modern web browser.

**⚙️ How It Works (Behind the Scenes):**

1.The user selects rock, paper, or scissors by clicking a button.

2.The computer randomly picks one of the three options.

3.A function compares the player’s choice and the computer’s choice:

*Rock beats Scissors

*Paper beats Rock

*Scissors beats Paper

*Same choices result in a tie

4.The game displays the result and updates the score accordingly.

**🌱 Future Opportunities:**

This project can be extended in several ways:

🎨 Improved UI/UX: Add sound effects, animations, or themes.

🧠 AI Opponent: Implement a simple learning algorithm that predicts player moves.

📱 Mobile Optimization: Enhance layout and responsiveness for better mobile experience.

🏆 Leaderboard: Store scores using local storage or a backend service.

🌐 Multiplayer Mode: Let two players compete on the same or different devices.
